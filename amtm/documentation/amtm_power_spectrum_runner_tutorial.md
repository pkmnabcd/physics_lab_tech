# Purpose of This Program
This program is a runner program for AMTM power spectrum processing and generation.

# Prerequisites
You need an environment like anaconda/spyder that has the following python libraries.
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

You also need IDL installed, as well as the path to the IDL folder.
It is typically installed at a path similar to `C:\Program Files\Harris\IDL89` for windows.
I think you need IDL version 8.5 or higher.

Make sure to have the following python programs in the same directory.
* `amtm_power_spectrum_runner.py`
* `power_spectrum_daily.py`

Make sure you have the following IDL `.pro` files at a known location.
They are often found in a directory similar to `C:\Users\Person\OneDrive\Desktop\MachineLearning\IDLCode`.
* `m_fft_asi.pro`
* `read_images_AMTM.pro`

# Setup
After making sure all of the prerequisites are met, open the python script `amtm_power_spectrum_runner.py` in spyder or an editor.
To use the program, you'll need to change several lines near the top of the script.
If you're unfamiliar with the `os.path.join` function, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-ospathjoin) before editing.

## **idl_scripts_dir**
The first line you'll have to edit is the following.
```python
idl_scripts_dir = join("C:\\", "Users", "Domi", "OneDrive", "Desktop", "MachineLearning", "IDLCode")
```
This directory should contain the IDL `.pro` files described above.

## **save_dir**
The second line you'll have to edit is the following.
```python
save_dir = join("C:\\", "Gabes_stuff", "AMTM_ALOMAR")
```
This directory is the main save directory for all processing output.
It should contain year folders and winter total power plots.
In the year directories, there should be month-year directories like `October2016`, inside which there should be (at least) the `days.txt` and will contain folders corresponding to the windows.
I hope I'm not overexplaining things, but I want to make clear that this is not the main directory of the drive where the images are stored.
This is the directory where data derived from those images are stored.

## **read_dir**
The third line you'll have to edit is the following.
```python
read_dir = join("I:\\")
```
This is the main directory where the raw data images are stored at, usually the root of the drive, but sometimes there's another subdirectory of the root you have to navigate to.
This directory should contain your `months.txt` file and the month-year folders like `October2016`.

## **year**



# Appendix A: os.path.join
## Motivation
The purpose of `join()` is to easily create a path, without having to consider your OS.
Windows typically follows the convention of using `\` to denote a directory, most other operating systems use `/`.
It also generally simplifies the combination of paths.
When given some number of paths or strings, it returns a path with directory markers put between the paths.

Consider the following example.
```python
from os.path import join

def combinePathsNoJoin(path1, path2, path3):
    return path1 + "\\" + path2 + "\\" + path3

def combinePathsWithJoin(path1, path2, path3):
    return join(path1, path2, path3)
```
Both of the defined functions do the same thing.

## Usage
In the code that I have you edit, I have you put your paths in as `join()`s.
This makes the code more cross-platform, and it ensures that the same conventions are followed throughout the program.

Take the following example.
```python
idl_scripts_dir = join("C:\\", "Users", "Domi", "OneDrive", "Desktop", "MachineLearning", "IDLCode")
```
It may seem like it would be easier to just do the following.
```python
idl_scripts_dir = "C:\\Users\\Domi\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\MachineLearning\\IDLCode"
```
However, someone may use `/` instead of `\\`, or even try `\`, which would produce errors.
These may mess with the system, so I think that it would be easier to just use `join()`.

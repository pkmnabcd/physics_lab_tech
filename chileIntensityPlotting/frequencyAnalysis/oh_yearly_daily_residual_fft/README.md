# Installation Notes
You must use poetry with this program to install the dependencies correctly. Follow some guide to install poetry on your system (linux, windows, etc), and then in this directory, run `poetry install`. Then, run `poetry shell` to launch a terminal window that has the correct dependencies loaded. Now you can run `python solarMonthlyFFT.py` or `python3 solarMonthlyFFT.py`, depending on your system.

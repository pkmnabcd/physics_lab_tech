# What is this repo?
This is a repository of code that I've made for my physics lab. I do a bunch of data analysis and processing, so most of this is just simple scripts that make my life easier. However, there are a few programs that are particularly large, and probably should have been their own repos, but I like keeping everything in one place for now.

5-Jan,,,1,clear,1,1,0,"thin, slow columns",lots of  waves between start and end,,,,,"Weather: I may have been somewhat too conservative with my sky condition evaluations until about November. A lot of the time, I put whispy clouds if there was any moving air, despite being able to clearly see the stars in the background. Ex 3-Jan I marked as whispy clouds, but I would now mark as at least mostly clear."

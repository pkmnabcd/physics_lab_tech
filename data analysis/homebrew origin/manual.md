# Homebrew Origin Graphing for Chile Intensity Data

This program is meant to replace the graphing format of Origin when using the ChileMTM intensity/temperature data. The program takes the file path of the desired file, as well as the filename itself as parameters (separated, examples below), and returns a graph of the data. This graph is saved in the output_graphs directory that is made in the given directory.

Unlike most programs developed in this lab, this program is meant to be run in a command line, without changing any code. You give the file name as parameters when you run the code from the command line. You also must make sure that a certain package is installed on the computer. All of this will be explained below.

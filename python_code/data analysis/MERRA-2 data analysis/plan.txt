Goal: refactor main.py and make it into a new file so that another file main.py has a public-facing method
that allows for the program to be used easily while keeping the previous security and functionality

goal for main method: main()
parameters:
Graphing temp T/F
Graphing wind T/F
Graphing single or multiple altitude levels
Graphs have bars on them on a certain day to illustrate changes on that day
smoothing T/F



merra object:
Data:
filepath
array of temp filenames
array of V filenames
array of U filenames
temp data at given altitude
wind datas at given altitude

whether graph should be smoothed
whether bar should be placed and where
